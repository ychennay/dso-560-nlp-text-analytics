    "## Model Evaluation: Choosing n in an n-Gram Model\n",
    "\n",
    "- the larger the dataset, and by implication, the more rich the corpus, the larger the n we can likely try.\n",
    "- in practice, $n = 2$, $n = 3$, $n = 4$ work well. A larger $n$ tends to begin to overfit (and may be computationally extremely expensive). Remember the **bias-variance** tradeoff:\n",
    "![http://scott.fortmann-roe.com/docs/BiasVariance.html](images/biasvariance.png)\n",
    "Here, as $n \\rightarrow \\infty$, model complexity increases dramatically.\n",
    "- **tune $n$ based on the performance of the downstream model**: usually n-gram models are the first step in a broader sentiment analysis prediction model, or topic modelling model, recommendation system, or sequence-to-sequence translation task.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Perplexity\n",
    "\n",
    "Look again at the definition of likelihood for a particular sentence:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "L = p(w) = \\prod_{i=0}^{s}p(w_i | w_{i-n}^{i})\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $w_{i-n}^{i}$ stands for $w_{i-n}, w_{i-n+1}, ..., w_{i-1}$ (if you have bi-gram (**`n=2`**) model, then you would have $w_{i-2}, w_{i-1}$)\n",
    "\n",
    "Is it reasonable to compare two sentences, one with $s=4$ (sentence length of 4 words) with the one below in Sentence B?\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Sentence A:\n",
    "> *I love to eat.*\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Sentence B:\n",
    "> *My escort was an exceptionally genial sixty-seven-year-old man named Don Seely, an electrical engineer who said that he was between jobs and using the unwanted free time to volunteer his services to the Northern Kentucky Tea Party, the rally’s host organization, as a Webmaster.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: **No**. A common way of quantifying the likelihood of your n-gram models, accounting for different sizes of test corpuses, is to use **perplexity**. Remember that our likelihood of seeing a particular sentence is \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "P = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt[N]{p(w)}}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "$N$ is the length of all the words in the test sentence. We typically use perplexity, instead of simply likelihood, as the overall model evaluation metric, because in general, **in order to compare two different models**, they should be using the same test corpus / vocabulary. "
